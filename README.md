Attribute information
Age - age in years,sex - (1 = male; 0 = female),cp - chest pain type,Trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern
,Chol – serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
,Fbs – fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl(1=true;0=false)
,restecg – resting electrocardiographic results
,Thalach – maximum heart rate achieved
,Exang - exercise include angina
,oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more
,Slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
,thal – thallium stress result

Conclusion
We determined the best machine learning method and the best  feature selection algorithm to predict heart attacks.
We found that the target variable in two possible ways i.e 1 and 0.If we get the predict the value as 1 then that means the person is suffering from heart attack.
This gives the status of the patient as risky.If we predict the value as 0 then that means the person is normal.We used classification type of machine learning .
